# Module 3: About Router Chain

## Features of Router Chain

A Blockchain focused primarily on enabling State Transitions across
Chains, the Router Chain will sit as a Hub between various EVM and non-EVM Ecosystems. Features that set Router Chain apart from other Interoperability Solutions include, but are not limited to -

1. ***Support for Middleware Contracts:*** Maintain States and implement Custom Business Logic directly in the Bridging Layer.
   
2. ***Plug-and-play for Developers:*** Router has a Transcendent open-source Developer Tooling Suite to assist with the Continuous Integration and Development of cross-chain dApps.

3. ***CrossTalk:*** Developers looking to build cross-chain applications without any Custom Bridging Logic can leverage Routerâ€™s easy-to-integrate Smart Contract Library, CrossTalk.

4. ***Support for various Kinds of Use Cases:*** Batching, Sequencing, and Atomicity can be enforced directly from the Router Chain.

5. ***Flexibility:*** Router provides Developers with the utmost Flexibility over their Bridging Model (stateless or stateful), Security Model, and Smart Contract Platform (EVM or CosmWasm).
   
6. ***Data aggregation:*** Contracts on the Router Chain can Serve as Data Aggregation Modules for various cross-chain and multi-chain applications.
   
7. ***Cross-chain Meta Transactions:*** By leveraging Router as their cross-chain Infra Provider, applications can enable Gasless cross-chain Transactions by Delegating the execution of a request to a third-party Service.

8. ***Composability:*** The Router Chain will have inbuilt Support for Global applications such as Oracles and Liquidity Pools/Bridges, to name a few, which will help in easier Integration of other applications.
