## Introduction

This Section Explores Diverse Use Cases of Router’s cross-chain Intent Framework, Demonstrating how it Addresses Challenges in Blockchain Adoption. Each example illustrates the Framework’s Practicality, Adaptability, and Potential to enhance Efficiency in Blockchain Interactions across Various Types of DeFi Applications.

- **cross-chain DeFi Applications:** cross-chain Intent Framework can be used to create cross-chain DeFi Applications including but not limited to cross-chain Liquid Staking, cross-chain Lending/Borrowing, and cross-chain Liquidity Position Manager among others. Such applications allow Users to put their Idle Funds to Good use by Allowing them to Stake their Funds in a Platform of their Choice, Extending Beyond the Blockchain where their Funds are Situated initially.

- **cross-chain NFT Marketplace:** cross-chain Intent Framework can be used to enhance the Accessibility of NFT Marketplaces by allowing Users to Bid and Buy NFTs from a Separate Chain altogether. Imagine a user Possessing an
  Ethereum-Based NFT who wishes to Trade it on a Polygon NFT Marketplace.

- **Automated Portfolio Rebalancing:** Router’s cross-chain Intent Framework presents Substantial Benefits for a Portfolio Management dApp. Using the Intent Solver, the dApp can Strategically Identify and Capitalize on Platforms Offering the Highest Yields. Following this, Stateful Portfolio Management Adapters can be used to dynamically manage User Assets and Optimize their Yields.
