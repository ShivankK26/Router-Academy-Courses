# Module 3: Introduction to Router Nitro & its Statistics

Welcome to the Module 3 Of the Router Nitro CookBook. In this module, we'll be Understanding what Router Nitro is and what are its Latest Statistics. Since the Launch of Router Nitro Mainnet, it has been Dominating the Industry so let's understand how it has been doing this. Let's Begin...

## Introduction To Router Nitro

- Router Protocol is a Solution introduced to address the issues Hindering the Usability of cross-chain Liquidity Migration in the DeFi Ecosystem. It acts as a Bridge Connecting various Layer 1 and Layer 2 Blockchains, allowing for the flow of contract-level Data across them. The Router Protocol can either Transfer Tokens between Chains or initiate Operations on one Chain and Execute them on another.

- Router Nitro is a cross-chain Swapping Engine or Protocol Designed to enable cross-chain Asset Transfers. It serves as a Mechanism for Seamlessly moving Digital Assets or Tokens between Different Blockchain Networks.

- Router Nitro employs a Trustless Method for managing cross-chain Asset Transfers. In this system, a Forwarder Entity delivers the Requested Asset to the user on the Destination Chain. After Confirming the Forwarder's Successful Settlement on the Destination Chain, they can access the user's Deposited Funds on the Source Chain.
