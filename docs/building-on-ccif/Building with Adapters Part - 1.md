# Module 2: Building with Adapters Part - 1

## Why there is a Need of Adapters?

Intent Adapters are used to Simplify the UX in Crypto so that Interacting with dApps becomes easy. Each Blockchain requires a Unique Wallet with its own set of Private Keys and Mnemonic Phrases, complicating the Security and Management of Assets. The need to manually Monitor and Transfer Assets across these Fragmented Systems introduces Inefficiencies and Increases the Risk of Errors and Security Breaches.

Staking in a Liquid Staking Platform on a Different Blockchain typically involves around 27 clicks, interaction with 3 Different dApps,
6 Wallet interactions, and up to 15 minutes of effort.

To accomplish a task like Staking on Stader, Users must be familiar with Multiple Blockchain Networks, Possess their espective Gas Assets, or know the processes for acquiring these Assets. Furthermore, a Comprehensive Understanding of Bridges for Asset Transfer
and Proficiency in Navigating DEXs or Aggregators is imperative.

## Usage of Smart Contracts

Intent Adapters are basically Series of Smart Contracts which are Developed in such a way that they ease out the way Users Interact with dApps. Whether it is Bridging or Transfer of Assets or Staking Tokens on Lido. It also includes Lending or Borrowing of Assets and Liquid Staking too.
