title: Introduction to Router Protocol
description: Story about Router Protocol, by Harsh Soni

In the  **Segregated States of Blockchain**, there were 2 villages where various nodes used to live. Both villages were isolated because no node from one village was connected to another. Now if they wanted to share the information or trade with the other village, they wouldn’t be able to do so, because there was no connection between them 😥.  
What can be done 🤔

⏳ There were many magicians like BormWhole 🦹‍♂️ who visited the Blockchain state but couldn’t help them (because they were slower than the sloth 🦥). Then, a superhero named  **Router Protocol 🦸‍♂️**️  was incarnated, and tried to establish mutual connections between these two villages. He used the mantra of interoperability and attempted to find a solution.

Router Protocol uses  **CrossTalk**  magical spell to share messages 💌 and Super Fast  **Router Nitro**  bridge 🌉to send assets across the Blockchain Villages 🤠.

The Blockchain world is Segregated because different blockchain networks operate  **independently**, lacking seamless communication and interoperability between them. This isolation obstacles the flow of information and assets across different blockchain platforms.

Interoperability refers to the ability of different systems or networks to  **work together**  and  **exchange information**  seamlessly. In the context of blockchain, interoperability solutions enable different blockchain networks to  **communicate**  and  **interact**  with each other.

Interoperability solves the segregation problem in the blockchain world by  **creating connections between otherwise isolated networks**. It allows for the  **transfer of assets**  and  **information**  across different blockchains, enabling more  **efficient trading**, communication, and collaboration between users and projects on various platforms. By bridging these networks, interoperability promotes a more interconnected and accessible blockchain ecosystem.
