## About Intent Store & XP Points

Intent Store serves as a Repository of open-source ‘Adapters’ that are Smart Contracts Designed to Execute User Intents on the Blockchain. Developers can use them to Transform their existing dApps into cross-chain Applications or to Create new, Seamless cross-chain dApps (including but not Limited to EVM and Cosmos-Based Chains).

These Adapters simplify the Complexities inherent in DeFi, facilitating Smooth and Efficient Interactions, whether those are with a Single dApp or Spanning Multiple dApps.

Additionally, we’re introducing Pipelines, a feature that allows Developers to Experiment with Multiple Adapters in a drag-and-drop Environment. The Concept of Intent-Based DeFi offers a Vital Solution by Abstracting the Intricate Technical Details involved in dApp Interactions. Ultimately, this Fosters a more Accessible and Innovative Ecosystem, encouraging Broader Engagement and facilitating Seamless Application Development in the Blockchain Space.

## Exploring Router’s Pre-Store Endeavors

Before Launching this Store, we laid down the Groundwork by Creating a Couple of Adapters and Showcased some Proof of Concepts (POCs). You can Check out examples like [Velocore+](https://velocore.routerintents.com/apps/velocore) and [Lido+](https://lido.routerintents.com/apps/lido) on our Website, where we Show how our Innovations can make a Difference.

And that’s not all! Our Ecosystem Project, [StakeEase](https://stakeease.com/), is already making Waves. Our Staking Adapters are Simplifying things for Users. Now, with just one Click, anyone can easily Restake any Token from any Chain into EigenLayer.

Our Team is Continuously Building more Adapters and Bringing them to you. Additionally, we’ll be Creating a Sandbox Environment for Developers in which Developers Receive the initial UI Template pre-integrated with the Adapter and Backend Pathfinder. This Serves as a ready-made Starting Point for Building Comprehensive Applications.

We’re eagerly awaiting Developers like you to join us and Empower Web3 Together. Let’s make things Easier and more Efficient for everyone!

## What’s More In The Store?

From the Above Section, it’s Clear that the Benefits of the new Intent-Based DeFi and our Store are Speaking Volumes. But there’s more in Store for you — Intent XP and Carrots!

When you Utilize our Adapters to either Upgrade your Existing dApps or Craft new ones, expect your User Base to Skyrocket. No longer Confined to a Single Chain or Ecosystem, your dApp will attract Users far and wide. And for every User who Engages with your dApp, providing the Service you Offer, you’ll Earn Intent XPs from us. These Points will Translate into Ecosystem Rewards Down the Line.

So, BUIDL! EARN XPs! RETIRE!
