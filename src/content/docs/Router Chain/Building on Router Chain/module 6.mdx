## Introduction

`router_wasm_bindings` is a `crate` package which we'll be using to Import all the features provided by Router Protocol. It includes methods for making your DApp CrossChain. Refer [this](https://docs.rs/router-wasm-bindings/1.0.3/router_wasm_bindings/all.html) Documentation to Learn in-detail the `router_wasm_bindings` package.

Now, Let's Explore Some of the Methods available in `router_wasm_bindings` package.

## Structs

### RouterQuerier

```rust
pub struct RouterQuerier<'a> { /* private fields */ }
```

This is a helper Wrapper to easily use our Custom Queries.

### CrossChainRequestResponse

```rust
pub struct CrosschainRequestResponse {
    pub request_identifier: u64,
    pub fee_deducted: Coin,
}
```

This is a Wrapper used to Record CrossChain Response.

### GasPriceResponse

```rust
pub struct GasPriceResponse {
    pub gas_price: u64,
}
```

This is a Wrapper used to Record Gas Price Response.

### RequestMetaData

```rust
pub struct RequestMetaData {
    pub dest_gas_limit: u64,
    pub dest_gas_price: u64,
    pub ack_gas_limit: u64,
    pub ack_gas_price: u64,
    pub relayer_fee: Uint128,
    pub ack_type: AckType,
    pub is_read_call: bool,
    pub asm_address: String,
}
```
This is a Wrapper used to get the Request Metadata to be used while Initiating cross-chain Request.

### TokenPriceResponse

```rust
pub struct TokenPriceResponse {
    pub token_price: Uint128,
    pub token_decimal: u64,
}
```

This is a Wrapper used to get the Token Price Response.

## Enums

### RouterMsg

```rust
pub enum RouterMsg {
    CrosschainCall {
        version: u64,
        route_amount: Uint128,
        route_recipient: String,
        dest_chain_id: String,
        request_metadata: Bytes,
        request_packet: Bytes,
    },
}
```

A number of Custom Messages that can Call into the Router Bindings.

### RouterQuery

```rust
pub enum RouterQuery {
    TokenPrice {
        symbol: String,
    },
    GasPrice {
        chain_id: String,
    },
}
```

An Enum used to Query Token Price and Gas Price.

### SudoMsg

```rust
pub enum SudoMsg {
    HandleIReceive {
        request_sender: String,
        src_chain_id: String,
        request_identifier: u64,
        payload: Binary,
    },
    HandleIAck {
        request_identifier: u64,
        exec_flag: bool,
        exec_data: Binary,
        refund_amount: Coin,
    },
}
```

An Enum consists of HandleIReceive and HandleIAck - 

- ***HandleIReceive*** - a function to handle the Acknowledgement received from the Destination Chain Back on the Source Chain.

- ***HandleIAck*** - function to handle the cross-chain Request received from some Other Chain.

### AckType

```rust
pub enum AckType {
    NoAck,
    AckOnSuccess,
    AckOnError,
    AckOnBoth,
}
```

An Enum which gives the Acknowledgement Type of the Request.

### ChainType

```rust
pub enum ChainType {
    ChainTypeNone,
    ChainTypeRouter,
    ChainTypeEvm,
    ChainTypeCosmos,
    ChainTypePolkadot,
    ChainTypeSolana,
    ChainTypeNear,
    ChainTypeTron,
    ChainTypeStarknet,
    ChainTypeBitcoin,
    ChainTypeSui,
    ChainTypeAlephZero,
}
```

An Enum which tells about the Type of the Chain.

## Functions

### `convert_address_from_bytes_to_string`

    address: &[u8],
    chain_type: u64,
) -> StdResult<String>
```

A function which is used to convert an Address from Bytes to String.
