## Summary & CheatSheet

Over the Past Few years, we have witnessed Web3 evolve from a Novel Innovation to an ethos Defining the new Era of Computation and Digital Governance. The Maturity of Ethereumâ€™s Infrastructure and Ecosystem fostered true Innovation, which has Paved the way for a variety of Decentralized Applications. However, Increased adoption by users led to Scalability issues, resulting in the Emergence of Multiple Layer 1 and Layer 2 Networks. Trilemma Design trade-offs in most of these Solutions have been focused on Reduced Gas Costs and improved throughput. While these new Networks have Played an essential Role in OnBoarding new users to the DeFi Ecosystem, their Proliferation has resulted in the Fragmentation of Liquidity, User Base, and activity across multiple Networks. 

Due to these factors, Interoperability is no longer a Luxury; it is a requirement for any dApp Seeking to Capitalize on the Subsequent Adoption Wave. Attempts have been made in the Past to Solve this Problem by enabling Communication across Chains, but their Usability is limited by a number of issues. This Course introduces the Router Chain, an Interoperability Hub built at a Crucial Intersection of Decentralization, Scalability, and Security. With an Architecture enabling Communication between various Blockchain Ecosystems - EVM & non-EVM, support for Middleware Contracts and application-specific Bridging Logic, provision for adding Custom Security measures, and a Developer Tooling Suite facilitating Continuous Integration and Development of cross-chain dApps, the Router Chain will Catalyze the Growth of the cross-chain Ecosystem.
