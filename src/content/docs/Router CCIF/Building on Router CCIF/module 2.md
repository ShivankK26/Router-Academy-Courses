Stader is a Liquid Staking Platform that Simplifies and enhances the Cryptocurrency Staking Process. Unlike Traditional Staking, where your Funds are Locked for a Specific Period, Stader offers a more Flexible and Liquid approach.

## How Stader Works?

- ***Deposit Your Crypto:*** Transfer your Cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH, MATIC) to Stader's Smart Contract.
  
- ***Receive Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs):*** In Return for your Staked Crypto, you'll Receive LSTs, which Represent your Share in the Staking Pool.
  
- ***Enjoy Liquidity:*** The Main Benefit of Stader is the Liquidity it Provides. You can Trade, Lend, or use these LSTs in other DeFi Protocols, just like any other Token.
  
- ***Earn Staking Rewards:*** As your Crypto Continues to Earn Staking Rewards, you'll Receive a Portion of those Rewards in the form of additional LSTs.
