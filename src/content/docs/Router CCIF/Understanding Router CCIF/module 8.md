## Components Of CCIF 04

Intent Solver is a Crucial Part of Router’s cross-chain Intent Framework Module. Its Primary Function is to find and Scrutinize Potential Execution Paths for the Executable. After identifying Potential Execution Paths along with the requisite Inputs for the Head Adapter in each Path, the Intent Solver employs Advanced multi-criteria Decision Making Algorithms to Discern the most Optimal Path.

Its Responsibilities also encompass the Generation and Optimization of Call Data for each Adapter in the Selected Path to ensure a Seamless Transaction Process. Upon Determination of the Optimal Path and Preparation of the Call Data, the Intent Solver Communicates the Entry Point Contract Address, along with the Call Data, back to the User.

## Intent Solver Components

The Intent Solver’s Effectiveness is anchored by its Key Components: Pathfinder, Simulator, and Calldata Composer. Pathfinder is responsible for Determining the Most Optimal Path Based on Different Criteria. The Simulator Performs real-time Transaction Simulation to ensure the Feasibility of the Paths prepared by the Pathfinder. The Calldata Composer assembles the Necessary Transaction Data for the Selected Path. In Synergy, these Components Collectively Propel the Intent Solver towards efficient Execution of User Intents on the Blockchain.

1. **Pathfinder:** The Pathfinder is an algorithm that identifies Potential Adapters from the Adapter
   Registry Module to execute the User’s Intent and Proposes Executable Paths. Leveraging Advanced Multicriteria Decision making Techniques, it also evaluates these Paths, giving Precedence to factors such as Cost Effectiveness, Time Efficiency, and the Maximization of Potential Yields. This Evaluation ensures that the Chosen Path Balances Cost Savings and low-latency Execution.

2. **Simulator:** As the name suggests, the Simulator is responsible for Simulating Transactions Pertaining to each Adapter in the Proposed path. This Component’s Primary Responsibility is to Guarantee the Proper Operation of every Adapter in the Proposed Sequence. In Instances where an Adapter fails to Yield a Successful Simulation, the Simulator Dismisses that Particular Path.

3. **Calldata Composer:** The CallData Composer is responsible for Preparing CallData for each Adapter in a Chosen Path and Synthesizing them into a Unified CallData Payload. This Unified Payload Embodies the Execution Blueprint of the User’s Intent, as Determined by the Optimal Path identified by the Pathfinder. It is this Aggregated CallData Payload that the User Ultimately Broadcasts on the Blockchain to Actualize their Intent, making the CallData Composer a Key Architect in the Process of Transforming user Intents into actual Blockchain Transactions.
