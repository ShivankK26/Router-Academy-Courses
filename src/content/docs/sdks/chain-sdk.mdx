## Setting Up the Project

1. Navigate to your Desired Workspace Directory and Create a new Directory for your Project using the <code>mkdir</code> Command and <code>cd</code> to that directory -

    ```
    mkdir my-router-chain-project
    cd my-router-chain-project
    ```

2. Initialize a <code>package.json</code> file, which will Manage your Project's Dependencies, using `yarn` -

    ```
    yarn init -y
    ```

3. Install TypeScript as a Development Dependency using `yarn` -

    ```
    yarn add -D typescript
    ```

4. Generate a Basic TypeScript Configuration file using the TypeScript Compiler -

    ```
    yarn tsc --init
    ```

    This creates a <code>tsconfig.json</code> file at the Root of your Project. It defines Compiler Options for how TypeScript code will be Transpiled to JavaScript.

5. Create a New file for your Application code with a <code>.ts</code> Extension (e.g., index.ts) -

    ```
    touch index.ts
    ```

6. Since TypeScript Code needs to be Compiled to JavaScript before <code>NodeJS</code> can Execute it, you'll use the `ts-node` Package for Development -

    Install <code>ts-node</code> as a Development Dependency:

    ```
    yarn add -D ts-node
    ```

7. Install the Latest Version of Asset Transfer SDK -

    ```
    yarn add @routerprotocol/router-chain-sdk-ts
    ```
