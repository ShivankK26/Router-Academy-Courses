In this Module, we'll be Covering some of the Limitations of Stader.

### Native Asset Staking Only

 - Stader only allows Staking of Native Assets on the Blockchain where its Smart Contract is Deployed (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon).

### Complex cross-chain Staking Process

1. If you have USDC on Avalanche and want to Stake on Ethereum, you face a Complex Process -
   
     - Swap USDC to ETH on Avalanche, Bridge ETH to Ethereum, and then Stake ETH on Stader.
     
     - Alternatively, Bridge USDC from Avalanche to Ethereum, Swap USDC to ETH, and then Stake ETH on Ethereum.
  
2. This Process can be Daunting for Novice Web3 Users.

### Cross-chain Liquidity Management

- If you Want your Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) on another Chain like Optimism, you must Bridge the LSTs to that Chain, adding further Complexity.
