import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## File Structure
 
In this Module, the File Structure under `src/` Directory is -

<FileTree>

- src/
  - contract.rs
  - data.rs
  - errors.rs
  - execution.rs
  - lib.rs
  - msg.rs
  - query.rs
  - state.rs
  - tests.rs

</FileTree>

## `Contract.rs`

Below is the Explaination of `Contract.rs` file - 

### Imports and Configuration

```rust
use crate::errors::ContractError;
use crate::execution::{try_accept, try_invite, try_play, try_reject};
use crate::msg::{ExecuteMsg, InstantiateMsg, QueryMsg};
use crate::query::{query_game, query_games};
use crate::state::GAMES_COUNT;
use cosmwasm_std::to_binary;
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use cosmwasm_std::{entry_point, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult};
use cw2::{get_contract_version, set_contract_version};
```

This Section Imports necessary Modules and Types -

- Custom Modules for Error Handling, Execution Logic, Message Definitions, Querying, and State Management.
- CosmWasm Standard Library Types and functions.
- CW2 for Contract Versioning.

### Contract Version

```rust
const CONTRACT_NAME: &str = "tic-tac-toe";
const CONTRACT_VERSION: &str = "0.1.0";
```

These Constants Define the Contract Name and Version, used for Migration Purposes.

### Instantiate Function

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn instantiate(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    set_contract_version(deps.storage, CONTRACT_NAME, CONTRACT_VERSION)?;
    GAMES_COUNT.save(deps.storage, &0)?;
    Ok(Response::new().add_attribute("action", "tic-tac-toe"))
}
```

This function is Called when the Contract is first Deployed -

- It Sets the Contract Version in Storage.
- Initializes the Games Count to 0.
- Returns a response with an "action" Attribute.

### Execute Function

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Invite { coord, opponent } => try_invite(deps, info, coord, opponent),
        ExecuteMsg::Reject { as_host, opponent, game_id } => try_reject(deps, info, as_host, opponent, game_id),
        ExecuteMsg::Accept { coord, host, game_id } => try_accept(deps, info, coord, host, game_id),
        ExecuteMsg::Play { as_host, coord, opponent, game_id } => try_play(deps, info, as_host, coord, opponent, game_id),
    }
}
```

This Function handles all state-changing Operations -

- It uses Pattern Matching to Route Different Types of Execute Messages to their respective Handler functions.
- Supports actions like Inviting a Player, Rejecting/accepting Invitations, and making Moves.

### Query Function

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn query(deps: Deps, _env: Env, msg: QueryMsg) -> StdResult<Binary> {
    match msg {
        QueryMsg::GetContractVersion {} => to_binary(&get_contract_version(deps.storage)?),
        QueryMsg::Game { key, game_id } => to_binary(&query_game(deps, key, game_id)?),
        QueryMsg::Games { status } => to_binary(&query_games(deps, status)?),
    }
}
```

This Function handles read-only Operations -

- It uses Pattern Matching to Route Different Types of Query Messages.
- Supports Queries for Contract Version, Specific Game Information, and Multiple Games based on Status.

## `data.rs`

Below is the Explaination of `data.rs` file - 

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::Addr;
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use crate::state::Game;
```

### Imports and Configuration

These are the Import Statements -

- `cosmwasm_std::Addr`: This is a Type from the CosmWasm Standard Library that represents a Blockchain Address.
- `schemars::JsonSchema`: This Trait is used to Generate JSON Schema for the Struct, which is useful for Documentation and Client-side Validation.
- `serde::{Deserialize, Serialize}`: These Traits allow the Struct to be Serialized and Deserialized, which is necessary for Storing and Retrieving Data from the Blockchain.
- `crate::state::Game`: This Imports the `Game` Type from the `state.rs` file in the same Crate, which likely Contains the Core Game State.

### Struct 

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct GameResponse {
    pub game: Game,
    pub host: Addr,
    pub opponent: Addr,
}
```

This Defines a Struct called `GameResponse` -

- The `#[derive(...)]` attribute automatically Implements Several Traits for the Struct -

  - `Serialize` and `Deserialize`: For Converting the Struct to and from formats like JSON.
  - `Clone`: Allows the Struct to be Duplicated.
  - `Debug`: Enables formatting of the Struct for Debugging Purposes.
  - `PartialEq`: Allows Instances of the Struct to be compared for Equality.
  - `JsonSchema`: Generates a JSON Schema for the Struct.

- The Struct has three Fields -

  - `game`: Of type `Game`, which likely Contains the Current State of the Game (board position, whose turn it is, etc.).
  - `host`: Of type `Addr`, representing the Blockchain Address of the Player who Created or is hosting the Game.
  - `opponent`: Also of type `Addr`, representing the Blockchain Address of the Other Player.

This `GameResponse` struct is used when Querying the Contract for Information about a Specific Game. It Packages together all the Relevant Information about a Game: its Current State and the Addresses of Both Players Involved.

## `errors.rs`

Below is the Explaination of `errors.rs` file -

### Imports and Configuration

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{Addr, StdError};
use thiserror::Error;
use super::state::Coord;
```

- `cosmwasm_std::{Addr, StdError}`: Imports the `Addr` Type (for blockchain addresses) and `StdError` (standard errors) from CosmWasm.
- `thiserror::Error`: A Library for easily Defining Custom Error Types.
- `super::state::Coord`: Imports the `Coord` Type from the `state.rs` file, likely representing Game Board Coordinates.

### Error Enum Definition

```rust
#[derive(Error, Debug, PartialEq)]
pub enum ContractError {
    // ... (error variants)
}
```

This Defines a Custom Error Enum called `ContractError`. The Derive Macros provide -

- `Error`: Implements the `std::error::Error` Trait.
- `Debug`: Allows formatting of the Error for Debugging.
- `PartialEq`: Allows Comparing Errors for Equality.

### Error Variants

1. Standard Error:
   ```rust
   #[error("{0}")]
   Std(#[from] StdError),
   ```
   Wraps Standard CosmWasm Errors.

2. Authorization Error:
   ```rust
   #[error("Unauthorized")]
   Unauthorized {},
   ```
   Used When an Operation is attempted by an Unauthorized Address.

3. Invalid Game Start:
   ```rust
   #[error("Game against yourself cannot be started")]
   CannotStartGame {},
   ```
   Prevents a Player from Starting a Game against themselves.

4. Duplicate Game:
   ```rust
   #[error("Game between {host} and {opponent} already exists. Complete the previous game to start a new one")]
   GameAlreadyInProgress { host: Addr, opponent: Addr },
   ```
   Prevents Starting a new Game when One already exists Between the same Players.

5. Game Not Found:
   ```rust
   #[error("Game between {host} and {opponent} not found. You cannot reject it")]
   GameNotFound { host: Addr, opponent: Addr },
   ```
   Used when Trying to Interact with a non-existent Game.

6. Invalid Game:
   ```rust
   #[error("Game between {host} and {opponent} is invalid. Try starting another game.")]
   InvalidGame { host: Addr, opponent: Addr },
   ```
   Indicates an Issue with the Game's State.

7. Coordinate Already Played:
   ```rust
   #[error("x={{coord.x}} and y={{coord.y}} already contain symbol. Try using another coordinate.")]
   CoordinateAlreadyPlayed { coord: Coord },
   ```
   Prevents Playing on an already Occupied Position.

8. Out of Turn Play:
   ```rust
   #[error("You already played this turn. Wait for '{{second_player}}' to play its turn.")]
   TurnAlreadyPlayed { second_player: String },
   ```
   Prevents a Player from making Multiple moves in a Row.

9. Invalid Coordinate:
   ```rust
   #[error("Invalid coordinate x={{coord.x}} y={{coord.y}}. Coordinates must be between 0 and 2")]
   InvalidCoord { coord: Coord },
   ```
   Ensures that Played Coordinates are within the Valid Range (0-2 for a 3x3 board).

10. Invalid Funds:
    ```rust
    #[error("The funds you send must be equal to the prize of the game")]
    InvalidReceivedFunds {},
    ```
    Ensures that the Correct amount of Funds is sent with game-related Transactions.

## `execution.rs`

This `execution.rs` file Contains the Core Logic for Executing Various actions in the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Implemented as a CosmWasm Smart Contract. Let's Break Down each function -

### 1. `try_invite`

This function handles the Invitation to Start a new Game.

```rust
pub fn try_invite(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    coord: Coord,
    opponent: String,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError>
```

Key points -

- Validates the Opponent's Address and the Initial Coordinate.
- Prevents self-play (playing against oneself).
- Increments and Saves the Game Count.
- Creates a new Game and Saves it to Storage.
- Returns a Response with Game Details.

### 2. `try_reject`

This function allows Rejecting a Game Invitation.

```rust
pub fn try_reject(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    as_host: bool,
    opponent: String,
    game_id: u64,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError>
```

Key points -

- Determines the Correct Key for the Game Based on whether the Rejector is the host or not.
- Checks if the Game exists and is in the INVITED State.
- Updates the Game Status to REJECTED.
- Refunds the Prize to the appropriate Address.

### 3. `try_accept`

This function handles accepting a Game Invitation.

```rust
pub fn try_accept(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    coord: Coord,
    host: String,
    game_id: u64,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError>
```

Key points -

- Validates the Coordinate and Checks if the Game exists and is in the INVITED State.
- Ensures the Coordinate hasn't been Played and the Correct funds are sent.
- Updates the Game State (doubles the prize, plays the move, finishes the round).
- Changes the Game Status to PLAYING.

### 4. `try_play`

This function handles making a Move in an Ongoing Game.

```rust
pub fn try_play(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    as_host: bool,
    coord: Coord,
    opponent: String,
    game_id: u64,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError>
```

Key points -

- Validates the Coordinate and Retrieves the Game.
- Checks if the Move is Valid (coordinate not played, correct player's turn).
- Updates the Game State with the new Move.
- Checks for a Win or Draw Condition.
- If the Game is Completed, handles Prize Distribution.
- Returns a response with the Updated Game State.

### Common Patterns

1. ***Error Handling:*** Each function returns a `Result<Response, ContractError>`, allowing for precise Error Management.
2. ***State Management:*** The Contract uses `GAMES` and `GAMES_COUNT` to manage Game States.
3. ***Fund Management:*** The Contract handles Prizes, including Doubling, Refunding, and Distributing based on Game Outcomes.
4. ***Response Building:*** Each function Constructs a `Response` with relevant attributes for client-side Processing.

## `lib.rs`

The `lib.rs` file Serves as the Root of the Rust Crate for the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Contract. Let's break it Down line by line -


### Imports and Configuration

```rust
pub mod contract;
```
This Declares a Public Module named `contract`. The `pub` Keyword makes this module accessible to other Crates that might use this one. This Module likely Contains the Main Contract Logic, including Entry Points for Instantiation, Execution, and Querying.

```rust
mod data;
mod errors;
mod execution;
mod msg;
mod query;
mod state;
```
These lines Declare several Private Modules. They're not prefixed with `pub`, so they're only accessible within this Crate. Each module likely Corresponds to a Separate file -

- `data`: Probably Contains Data Structures used throughout the Contract.
- `errors`: Defines Custom Error Types for the Contract.
- `execution`: Likely Contains the Logic for Executing various Contract Actions.
- `msg`: Probably Defines Message Types for Contract Interactions.
- `query`: Likely Contains Logic for Querying Contract State.
- `state`: Probably Defines the Contract's State and Storage Logic.

```rust
pub use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
```
This Line re-exports the `Deserialize` and `Serialize` Traits from the `serde` Crate. This makes these Traits available to Users of this Crate without them needing to explicitly Import `serde`. These Traits are Crucial for Serialization and Deserialization in CosmWasm Contracts.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
```
This Declares a `tests` Module that's only Compiled when Running Tests (due to the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute). This is where Unit Tests for the Contract would be located.

## `msg.rs`

This `msg.rs` file Defines the Message Structures used for Interacting with the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Contract. These Structures are Crucial for Defining how Users and other Contracts can Interact with this Smart Contract.

### Imports and Common Traits

```rust
use schemars::JsonSchema;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use crate::state::{Coord, Status};
```

- `JsonSchema`: For Generating JSON Schema for the Structs.
- `Deserialize`, `Serialize`: For Converting between Rust Types and JSON.
- `Coord`, `Status`: Custom Types from the Contract's `state` Module.

All Structs and Enums are Derived with `Serialize`, `Deserialize`, `Clone`, `Debug`, `PartialEq`, and `JsonSchema` traits, which are Standard for CosmWasm Message Types.

### InstantiateMsg

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
pub struct InstantiateMsg {}
```

This Empty Struct is used when Instantiating the Contract. In this case, no Initial Configuration is needed.

### ExecuteMsg

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Invite { coord: Coord, opponent: String },
    Reject { as_host: bool, opponent: String, game_id: u64 },
    Accept { coord: Coord, host: String, game_id: u64 },
    Play { as_host: bool, coord: Coord, opponent: String, game_id: u64 },
}
```

This Enum Defines the possible Execute Messages -

1. `Invite`: Start a new Game, specifying the first Move and Opponent.
2. `Reject`: Reject a Game Invitation.
3. `Accept`: Accept a Game Invitation and make the first Move.
4. `Play`: Make a Move in an Ongoing Game.

The `#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]` attribute Ensures that the Enum Variants are Serialized in snake_case, which is the Convention in JSON.

### QueryMsg

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    GetContractVersion {},
    Game { key: QueryKey, game_id: u64 },
    Games { status: Option<Status> },
}
```

This enum defines the possible query messages -

1. `GetContractVersion`: Retrieve the Contract's Version Information.
2. `Game`: Query a Specific Game by its Key and ID.
3. `Games`: Query Multiple Games, Optionally filtered by Status.

### QueryKey

```rust
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Clone, Debug, PartialEq, JsonSchema)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
pub struct QueryKey {
    pub host: String,
    pub opponent: String,
}
```

This Struct is used to Specify the Key for Querying a Specific Game, Consisting of the host and Opponent addresses.

## `query.rs`

The `query.rs` file Defines two Main Query functions for the Tic-Tac-Toe Game Contract: `query_game` and `query_games`. These functions allow Users or other Contracts to retrieve Information about Specific Games or Sets of Games.

### Imports and Configuration

```rust
#[cfg(not(feature = "library"))]
use crate::data::GameResponse;
use crate::msg::QueryKey;
use crate::state::{Status, GAMES};
use cosmwasm_std::{Deps, Order, StdResult};
```

- `GameResponse`: A Struct representing the response format for Game Queries.
- `QueryKey`: A Struct used to Specify the Key for Querying a Specific Game.
- `Status`, `GAMES`: From the Contract's State Module, likely an Enum for Game Status and a Storage Map for Games.
- `Deps`, `Order`, `StdResult`: CosmWasm Standard Types for Dependency Injection, Ordering, and Results.

### query_game Function

```rust
pub fn query_game(deps: Deps, key: QueryKey, game_id: u64) -> StdResult<Vec<GameResponse>> {
    // ... (implementation)
}
```

This function Queries a Specific Game -

1. It Validates the Host and Opponent Addresses from the `QueryKey`.
2. It attempts to Load the Game from Storage using `GAMES.may_load()`.
3. If the Game is found, it Constructs a `GameResponse` with the Game Data and Player addresses.
4. It returns a Vector Containing either one `GameResponse` (if the game is found) or an Empty Vector (if not found).

### query_games Function

```rust
pub fn query_games(deps: Deps, status: Option<Status>) -> StdResult<Vec<GameResponse>> {
    // ... (implementation)
}
```

This function Queries Multiple Games, Optionally filtered by Status -

1. It uses `GAMES.range()` to Iterate over all Games in Storage.
2. For each Game, it Constructs a `GameResponse` with the Game Data and Player addresses.
3. If a Status filter is Provided, it filters the Results to include only Games matching that Status.
4. It returns a Vector of all matching `GameResponse` Objects.

### Error Handling

Both functions return `StdResult<Vec<GameResponse>>`, allowing for Propagation of any Errors that might occur During address Validation or Storage access.

## `state.rs`



## `tests.rs`

This file Basically Comprises of all the Tests Scripts used for Testing of the Smart Contract.
