## Understanding CosmWasm Code

Go to your `src/lib.rs` file, and Start with an `instantiate` Entry Point -

```rust
use cosmwasm_std::{
    entry_point, Binary, Deps, DepsMut, Empty, Env, MessageInfo, Response, StdResult,
};

#[entry_point]
pub fn instantiate(
    _deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    _info: MessageInfo,
    _msg: Empty,
) -> StdResult<Response> {
    Ok(Response::new())
}
```

Let's Break this Down -

- `#[entry_point]` is an Attribute Macro that marks this function as an Entry Point for the Smart Contract. It's used by CosmWasm to identify the Contract's functions.

- `pub fn instantiate` Defines a Public function named `instantiate`. This function is called when the Contract is first Deployed to the Blockchain.

- The function takes four Parameters -
  - `_deps: DepsMut`: Mutable Dependencies, allowing the Contract to Interact with its Environment.
  - `_env: Env`: Information about the Current Blockchain Environment.
  - `_info: MessageInfo`: Meta-information about the Message that Triggered this Contract Call.
  - `_msg: Empty`: The Message Payload, which in this Case is `Empty`, meaning no Data is Expected.

- The Underscore Prefix (`_`) on these Parameters indicates that they're Currently unused in the function Body.

- The function returns a `StdResult<Response>`, which is a type alias for `Result<Response, StdError>`. This allows the function to return either a Successful `Response` or an Error.

- In the function Body, `Ok(Response::new())` Creates a new, empty `Response` Object and Wraps it in `Ok`, indicating Successful Execution.
