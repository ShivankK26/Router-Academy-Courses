## Basic Concepts

- To Learn the Basics of CosmWasm, Click [here](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/). You can Refer CosmWasm Book [here](https://book.cosmwasm.com/).

- To Learn the Basics of Rust, Click [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Creating a CosmWasm Project

To Create a CosmWasm Project, Run the following Command -

```bash
cargo generate --git https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-template.git --name PROJECT_NAME
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Watch out!">
  Before Running the above Command, make sure that you have Cargo Installed. To verify that you have Cargo Installed, Run -

  ```bash
  cargo --version
  ```
</Aside>

This will Create a new CosmWasm Project in the Current Directory.

## Project Structure

After Running the above Command, you'll get the Project Structure as follows -

<FileTree>

- .cargo/
  - config.toml
- .circleci/
  - config.yml
- .github/
  - workflows/
    - Basic.yml
    - Release.yml
- src/
  - bin/
    - schema.rs
  - contract.rs
  - error.rs
  - helpers.rs
  - lib.rs
  - msg.rs
  - state.rs
- .editorconfig
- .gitignore
- Cargo.lock
- Cargo.toml
- LICENSE
- NOTICE
- ReadME.md

</FileTree>

Now, Let's Understand the Project Structure a bit - 

1. `Cargo.toml` - This is the Manifest file for Rust's Package Manager, Cargo. It Defines the Project's Dependencies, Metadata, and Build Settings.
2. `src/contract.rs` - This is the Main file Containing your Smart Contract Logic. It typically includes the Contract's Entry Points (instantiate, execute, query).
3. `src/msg.rs` - Defines the Message Structs for your Contract's Interface, including InstantiateMsg, ExecuteMsg, and QueryMsg.
4. `src/state.rs` - Contains definitions for the Contract's State, often using Storage Primitives from the `cw_storage_plus` crate.
5. `src/error.rs` - Defines Custom Error Types for your Contract.
6. `src/lib.rs` - The Library's root file, which usually re-exports important items from other modules.
7. `src/bin/schema.rs` - Generates JSON Schema files for your Contract's messages, which can be used for front-end Integration.
8. `tests/` - Directory Containing Integration Tests for your Contract.
9. `examples/schema.rs` - An Example file Demonstrating how to use the Contract's Schema.
10. `.cargo/config` - Contains Cargo Configuration, Often used to set the Target for WebAssembly Compilation.
11. `.gitignore` - Specifies files that Git should ignore.

## Entry Points

Unlike Native applications, which have only a Single Main Entry Point, Smart Contract have a Couple Corresponding to Different Message Types: `instantiate`, `execute`, `query`, `sudo`, `migrate` and more.

- `instantiate` - function is called when the Contract is first created. It is Used to Initialize the Contract's State.

- `execute` - function is called when the Contract is called to Perform an Action. It is Used to Update the Contract's State.

- `query` - function is called when the Contract is Queried. It is Used to Read the Contract's State.

## Building & Deploying the Contract

After you've had the Project Structure Initialized with you, it is time to Compile & Build the Contract. Run the following Command in yout Directory to Build the Smart Contract - 

```bash
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

After Building the Smart Contract, you need to Deploy them and in CosmWasm that is being done using the `.wasm` file you get in the `target` folder.

## Possible Errors you Might Get

<Aside type="danger">
While Building your Contract it might give you an error related to - 
wasm32-unknown-unknown may not be installed.
</Aside>

For this try Running the Below Command - 

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

But if it Still gives an Error then Run - 

```bash
export PATH=~/.cargo/bin:$PATH 
```

To Permanantly Solve this Issue, Go to your Root Terminal and try Running the Command -

```bash
ls -a
```

Look out for `.zshrc`, Open the file and add `export PATH=~/.cargo/bin:$PATH` Command to it.
